    "In the collaborative filtering sections, you became quite familiar with different methods of determining the similarity (or distance) of two users.  We can perform similarities based on content in much the same way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it turns out that one of the fastest ways we can find out how similar items are to one another (when our matrix isn't totally sparse like it was in the earlier section) is by simply using matrix multiplication.  If you are not familiar with this, an explanation is available [here by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0) and another quick explanation is provided [in the post here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/689022/how-does-the-dot-product-determine-similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "For us to pull out a matrix that describes the movies in our dataframe in terms of content, we might just use the indicator variables related to **year** and **genre** for our movies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can obtain a matrix of how similar movies are to one another by taking the dot product of this matrix with itself.  Notice below that the dot product where our 1 values overlap gives a value of 2 indicating higher similarity.  In the second dot product, the 1 values don't match up.  This leads to a dot product of 0 indicating lower similarity.\n",

    "We can perform the dot product on a matrix of movies with content characteristics to provide a movie by movie matrix where each cell is an indication of how similar two movies are to one another.  In the below image, you can see that movies 1 and 8 are most similar, movies 2 and 8 are most similar, and movies 3 and 9 are most similar for this subset of the data.  The diagonal elements of the matrix will contain the similarity of a movie with itself, which will be the largest possible similarity (and will also be the number of 1's in the movie row within the orginal movie content matrix).\n",
